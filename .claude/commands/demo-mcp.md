description: Demonstrate fd-mcp tools with live examples
---

Demonstrate the power of fd-mcp tools by running several quick examples:

1. **Fast file search**: Use mcp__fd__fd_search to find Python files (extension="py")
2. **Content search**: Use mcp__fd__fd_search_content to find "def " in Python files with context
3. **Recent files**: Use mcp__fd__fd_recent_files to show files changed in last 24 hours
4. **File count**: Use mcp__fd__fd_count to count total files

For each operation, explain:
- Which tool you're using
- Why it's better than bash alternatives
- The speed advantage (5-10x faster for search, 10-100x for content search)

Show the user how easy and fast these tools are!
